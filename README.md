Dan's Scouting Software (2019)

# Programming priorities

1. Add the "crossed line" param to our scouting app
2. TBA API for viewing matches??

   We can use this API also to verify our scouting forms. In the details section, each match will have more info, with the json attached. We can then compare TBA data to our scouted software.
   
3. Create generalized heatmap for all listed teams (with option to disable this)
4. Create app to pit teams against each other and determine probability of winning
5. Font awesome additions
